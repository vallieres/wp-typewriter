# WP Typewriter — Markdown for Wordpress

Typewriter replaces the Visual Editor with a simple Markdown editor for your posts and pages.

This is copied from an existing, non maintained plugin, called [WP Typewriter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typewriter/). It had an old version of MarkdownExtra libraries by [Michel Fortin](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/)

_Sourced from v.1.0 (2013-9-26)_

## Changelog

`v.1.1 — 2015-04-02`  
* Fixed issue #1
* Updated to the latest MarkdownExtra PHP libs
